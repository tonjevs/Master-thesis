	title = {Systematic review on gait classifications in children with cerebral palsy\_ An update},
	abstract = {Background: Gait classification systems ({GCSs}) aim to aid clinicians and researchers in categorizing the gait of pathological populations, with the intent to improve the communication between them, to support treatment planning and enable the evaluation of patients over time. Throughout the years, various {GCSs} have been defined for children with cerebral palsy ({CP}), which were first summarized in a systematic review published in 2007. Research question: The current systematic review aimed to: a) identify {GCSs} that have been more recently developed, b) appraise their methodological quality and c) specify the most commonly used multiple joint gait patterns for children with {CP} reported in literature.
Methods: Four databases (Medline, {EMBASE}, {CINAHL}, Web of Science) were searched until July 2017. Several forms of validity and the reliability of these studies were assessed according to the principles of the consensusbased standards for the selection of health measurement instruments checklist or criteria defined in the original review. All published {GCSs} were also scrutinized in order to identify multiple joint patterns that have reached a predefined level of consensus.
Results: Thirty-six studies were considered in this review, 15 of them being {GCSs} that were not included in the original review. The validity, reliability and clinical applicability of all {GCSs} was reported, including 3 studies from the original review. Six multiple joint patterns for children with {CP} reached a consensus in literature.
Conclusion: Since the previous review, obvious progress has been made in the field of {GCSs} for {CP}, resulting in improved methodological quality of the majority of published {GCSs}. This encouraged the applicability of {GCSs} in clinical or research settings. The six reliable, valid and commonly used multiple joint patterns, emerging from this systematic review, may aid clinical and research applications and create a common language among healthcare providers.},

The motion measurement system utilizes a video-based data collection strategy similar to commercially available systems for motion data collection. Anatomically aligned, passive, retroreflective markers placed on the subject are illuminated, detected, and stored in dedicated camera hardware while data are acquired from force platforms and {EMG} transducers. Three-dimensional marker position information is used to determine: (i) the orientation of segmentally-embedded coordinate systems, (ii) instantaneous joint center locations, and (iii) joint angles. Joint kinetics, i.e., moments and powers, may also be computed if valid force plate data are collected.},

	abstract = {A simple external marker system and algorithms for computing lower extremity joint angle motion during level walking were developed and implemented on a computer-aided video motion analysis system ({VICON}). The concept of embedded axes and Euler rotation angles was used to define the three-dimensionaljoint angle motion based on a set of body surface markers. Gait analysis was peformed on 40 normal young adults three times on three different test days at least 1 week apart using the marker system. Angular motion of the hip, knee, and ankle joints and of the pelvis were obtained throughout a gait cycle utilizing the three-dimensionaltrajectories of markers. The effect of uncertainties in defining the embedded axis on joint angles was demonstrated using sensitivity analysis. The errors in the estimation of joint angle motion were quantified with respect to the degree of error in the construction of embedded axes. The limitations of the model and the marker system in evaluatingpathologicgait are discussed.The relatively small number of body surface markers used in the system render it easy to implement for use in routine clinical gait evaluations. Additionally, data presented in this paper should be a useful reference for describing and comparing pathologic gait patterns.

Methods.  Four hundred sixty-three patients with gliomas who underwent preoperative {MRI} were enrolled in the study. All the patients had immunohistopathologic diagnoses of either {IDH}-wildtype or {IDH}-mutant gliomas.Tumor subregions were segmented using a convolutional neural network followed by manual correction. {DSC} perfusion {MRI} was performed to obtain T2* susceptibility signal intensity-time curves from each subregion of the tumors: enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, peritumoral edema, and whole tumor.These, with arterial input functions, were fed into a neural network as multidimensional inputs. A convolutional long short-term memory model with an attention mechanism was developed to predict {IDH} genotypes. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was performed to evaluate the model.
Results. The {IDH} genotype predictions had an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 92.8\%, 92.6\%, and 93.1\%, respectively, in the validation set (area under the curve [{AUC}], 0.98; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.969–0.991) and 91.7\%, 92.1\%, and 91.5\%, respectively, in the test set ({AUC}, 0.95; 95\% {CI}, 0.898–0.982). In temporal feature analysis, T2* susceptibility signal intensity-time curves obtained from {DSC} perfusion {MRI} with attention weights demonstrated high attention on the combination of the end of the pre-contrast baseline, up/downslopes of signal drops, and/or post-bolus plateaus for the curves used to predict {IDH} genotype.
Conclusions.  We developed an explainable recurrent neural network model based on {DSC} perfusion {MRI} to predict {IDH} genotypes in gliomas.},

            Clinical gait analysis is a crucial step for identifying foot disorders and planning surgery. Automating this process is essential for efficiently assessing the substantial amount of gait data. In this study, we explored the potential of state-of-the-art machine learning ({ML}) and explainable artificial intelligence ({XAI}) algorithms to automate all various steps involved in gait analysis for six specific foot conditions. To address the complexity of gait data, we manually created new features, followed by recursive feature elimination using Support Vector Machines ({SVM}) and Random Forests ({RF}) to eliminate low-variance features. {SVM}, {RF}, K-nearest Neighbor ({KNN}), and Logistic Regression ({LREGR}) were compared for classification, with a Majority Voting ({MV}) model combining trained models. {KNN} and {MV} achieved mean balanced accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score of 0.87. All models were interpreted using Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation ({LIME}) method and the five most relevant features were identified for each foot condition. High success scores indicate a strong relationship between selected features and foot conditions, potentially indicating clinical relevance. The proposed {ML} pipeline, adaptable for other foot conditions, showcases its potential in aiding experts in foot condition identification and planning surgeries.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose {LIME}, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classiﬁer in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the ﬂexibility of these methods by explaining diﬀerent models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classiﬁcation (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classiﬁer, and identifying why a classiﬁer should not be trusted.},

On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Purpose: to compare several machine learning algorithms employed for gait pattern recognition in motor disorders using discriminant features extracted from gait dynamics. Additionally, this work highlights procedures that improve gait recognition performance.
Methods: we conducted an electronic literature search on Web of Science, {IEEE}, and Scopus, using “human recognition”, “gait patterns’’, and “feature selection methods” as relevant keywords.
Results: analysis of the literature showed that kernel principal component analysis and genetic algorithms are eﬃcient at reducing dimensional features due to their ability to process nonlinear data and converge to global optimum. Comparative analysis of machine learning performance showed that support vector machines ({SVMs}) exhibited higher accuracy and proper generalization for new instances.
Conclusions: automatic recognition by combining dimensional data reduction, cross-validation and normalization techniques with {SVMs} may offer an objective and rapid tool for investigating the subject’s clinical status. Future directions comprise the real-time application of these tools to drive powered assistive devices in free-living conditions.},

Convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) are a type of deep models that can act directly on the raw inputs, thus automating the process of feature construction. However, such models are currently limited to handle 2D inputs. In this paper, we develop a novel 3D {CNN} model for action recognition. This model extracts features from both spatial and temporal dimensions by performing 3D convolutions, thereby capturing the motion information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. The developed model generates multiple channels of information from the input frames, and the ﬁnal feature representation is obtained by combining information from all channels. We apply the developed model to recognize human actions in real-world environment, and it achieves superior performance without relying on handcrafted features.},

	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a uniﬁed framework for interpreting predictions, {SHAP} ({SHapley} Additive {exPlanations}). {SHAP} assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identiﬁcation of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class uniﬁes six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this uniﬁcation, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

	abstract = {Cerebral palsy ({CP}) children present complex and heterogeneous motor disorders that cause gait deviations. Clinical gait analysis ({CGA}) is needed to identify, understand and support the management of gait deviations in {CP}. {CGA} assesses a large amount of quantitative data concerning patients’ gait characteristics, such as video, kinematics, kinetics, electromyography and plantar pressure data. Common gait deviations in {CP} can be grouped into the gait patterns of spastic hemiplegia (drop foot, equinus with different knee positions) and spastic diplegia (true equinus, jump, apparent equinus and crouch) to facilitate communication. However, gait deviations in {CP} tend to be a continuum of deviations rather than well delineated groups. To interpret {CGA}, it is necessary to link gait deviations to clinical impairments and to distinguish primary gait deviations from compensatory strategies. {CGA} does not tell us how to treat a {CP} patient, but can provide objective identification of gait deviations and further the understanding of gait deviations. Numerous treatment options are available to manage gait deviations in {CP}. Generally, treatments strive to limit secondary deformations, re-establish the lever arm function and preserve muscle strength. Additional roles of {CGA} are to better understand the effects of treatments on gait deviations.

A literature review was conducted to identify references related to human gait analysis published between January 2000 and September 2009 plus relevant older references. The references were assessed independently by four reviewers using a hierarchical model of efficacy adapted for gait analysis, and final scores were agreed upon by at least three of the four reviewers. 1528 references were identified relating to human instrumented gait analysis. Of these, 116 original articles addressed technical accuracy efficacy, 89 addressed diagnostic accuracy efficacy, 11 addressed diagnostic thinking and treatment efficacy, seven addressed patient outcomes efficacy, and one addressed societal efficacy, with some of the articles addressing multiple levels of efficacy. This body of literature provides strong evidence for the technical, diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic thinking and treatment efficacy of gait analysis. The existing evidence also indicates efficacy at the higher levels of patient outcomes and societal cost-effectiveness, but this evidence is more sparse and does not include any randomized controlled trials. Thus, the current evidence supports the clinical efficacy of gait analysis, particularly at the lower levels of efficacy, but additional research is needed to strengthen the evidence base at the higher levels of efficacy.},

For the deep neural networks, Grad-{CAM} explanations were aggregated on different levels to obtain explanations at the decision, class and model level. We investigate which subsets of 3D gait analysis data are particularly suitable for the classification of {CP}-related gait patterns. The results demonstrate the superiority of kinematic over ground reaction force data for this classification task and show that traditional {ML} approaches such as random forests and decision trees achieve better results and focus more on clinically relevant regions compared to deep neural networks. The best configuration, using sagittal knee and ankle angles with a random forest, achieved a classification accuracy of 93.4 \% over all four {CP} classes (crouch gait, apparent equinus, jump gait, and true equinus). Deep neural networks utilized not only clinically relevant features but also additional ones for their predictions, which may provide novel insights into the data and raise new research questions.

            Machine learning ({ML}) techniques such as (deep) artificial neural networks ({DNN}) are solving very successfully a plethora of tasks and provide new predictive models for complex physical, chemical, biological and social systems. However, in most cases this comes with the disadvantage of acting as a black box, rarely providing information about what made them arrive at a particular prediction. This black box aspect of {ML} techniques can be problematic especially in medical diagnoses, so far hampering a clinical acceptance. The present paper studies the uniqueness of individual gait patterns in clinical biomechanics using {DNNs}. By attributing portions of the model predictions back to the input variables (ground reaction forces and full-body joint angles), the Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation ({LRP}) technique reliably demonstrates which variables at what time windows of the gait cycle are most relevant for the characterisation of gait patterns from a certain individual. By measuring the time-resolved contribution of each input variable to the prediction of {ML} techniques such as {DNNs}, our method describes the first general framework that enables to understand and interpret non-linear {ML} methods in (biomechanical) gait analysis and thereby supplies a powerful tool for analysis, diagnosis and treatment of human gait.},
